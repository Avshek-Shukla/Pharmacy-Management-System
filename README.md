##Introduction
Pharmacy Management System is actually based on taking medicine orders and paying bills. When a user orders a medicine, he/she get a receipt number which is used to check order and clear payments. Also A verified user can input medicines data in his store add them but here we have not used due to lack of knowledge on file handling. We have just showed that how it works and used arrays and strings for the execution process. 
By Using C Programming We Successfully Developed A Sample Project For Pharmacy Management System Showing How This System Works. Here We Used Functions, Arrays, And Strings To Complete Our Project. The Only Limitation Here Is That It Can not Store The  Datas Permanently Because We Have Not Used File Handling But This Project Successfully Shows The Working System And Gives The Idea About It. By Using This Idea Project Can Be Made Professional And Dynamic And Can Be Used In Large Scale If Storage System Is Made Using File Handling In C.
