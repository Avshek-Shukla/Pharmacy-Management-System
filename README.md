          Pharmacy Management System is actually based on taking medicine orders and paying bills. When a user orders a medicine, he/she get a receipt number which is used to check order and clear payments. Also A verified user can input medicines data in his store add them but here we have not used due to lack of knowledge on file handling. We have just showed that how it works and used arrays and strings for the execution process.
